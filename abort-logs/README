This log group shows two tests

sender
  * send-abort 1
  * send-abort 10

broker
  * broker

receiver
  * receive 1
  * receive 10

In the 10 case:
  * send-abort pumps out batches of 79K bytes
  * receive receives nothing
  * broker receives one aborted message
    and then ignores a whole batch of pn_delivery
    events while incoming bytes builds up

The 1 case does the same thing but it is hard to tell.
